### Promises
__Promise:__ An object that is used as a placeholder for the future result of an asynchronous operation

__Advantages of using Promises:__
1. We no longer need to rely on events and callbacks passed into asynchronous functions to handle asynchronous results
2. Instead of nesting callbacks, we can __chain promises__ for a sequence of asynchronous operations: __escaping callback hell__
