### Closures
- A closure is the closed-over __variable environment__ of the execution context in which a function was created, even after that execution context is gone;
- A closure gives a function access to all the variables __of its parent function__, even after that parent function has returned. The function keeps a reference to its outer scope, which preserves the scope chain throughout time
