### Data types
Primitive data types
- Number: `let age = 23;`
- String: `let firstName = "Maksym";`
- Boolean: `let fullAge = true;`
- Undefined: Variable that is not yet defined `let children;`
- Null: `let data = null`
- Symbol: Value that is unique and cannot be changed
- BigInt: Larger integers that the Number type can hold

JavaScript has _dynamic typing_ - we do not have to manually define the data type of the value stored in a variable. Instead, data types are determined _automatically_
